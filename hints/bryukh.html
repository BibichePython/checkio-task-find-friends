        Create two sets (arrays) for future and visited nodes. Start at the first node (second argument), add it to
        visited. Find all of the neighbors and add them to the "future" set.

    <div class="answer">
        For each node check if this might be the friend we are searching for. To find neighbors you can create a
        connection dictionary, or just iterate the initial array and use "split('-')".
