    Sophia's drones are not soulless stupid drones. They can be friends.
    And they already are working for the their own social network.
    Sophia got the data about connections between drones and she wants to know more about relations inside her drones.
</p>

<p>
    We have an array of straight connections between drones.
    Each connection is represented as a string with two names of friends separated by hyphen.
    For example: "dr101-mr99" means what the <em>dr101</em> and <em>mr99</em> are friends.
    Your should write a function that allow determine more complex connection between drones.
    You are given two names also. Try to determine is they are related through common bonds any depth.
    For example: if two drones have a common friends or friends who have common friends and so on.
