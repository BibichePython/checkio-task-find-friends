    Sophia's drones are not soulless stupid drones. They can be friends.
    And they already are working for the their own social network.
    Sophia got the data about connections between drones and she wants to know more about relations inside her drones.
</p>

<p>
    We have an array of straight connections between drones.
    Each connection is represented as a string with two names of friends separated by hyphen.
    For example: "dr101-mr99" means what the <em>dr101</em> and <em>mr99</em> are friends.
    Your should write a function that allow determine more complex connection between drones.
    You are given two names also. Try to determine is they are related through common bonds any depth.
    For example: if two drones have a common friends or friends who have common friends and so on.

    <img class="for_editor_only" title="network" src="{{MEDIA}}network.png" alt="network" width="380px"/>
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at examples.<br>
    <em>scout2</em> and <em>scout3</em> have the common friend <em>scout1</em> so they are related.
    <em>super</em> and <em>scout2</em>  are related through <em>sscout</em>, <em>scout4</em> and <em>scout1</em>.
    But <em>dr101</em> and <em>sscout</em> are not related.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments: Information about friends as a tuple of lists; first name as a string;
    second name as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Are these drones related or not as a boolean.

    <pre class="brush: python">

     "scout3-scout1", "scout1-scout4", "scout4-sscout", "sscout-super"),
    "dr101", "sscout") == False
    </pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept will help you find not too obvious connections with the building of bond networks.
    And how to work social networks.
